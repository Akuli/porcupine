This folder inculdes wheels of py-tree-sitter-languages for Windows. I made a pull request to
py-tree-sitter-languages to add Windows support, but it isn't released yet.

The wheels contain binaries for projects licensed under various different licenses. See the
license section in the README of https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages for
details.

The wheels are from the build artifacts zip of commit e13e7f4 in my pull request:
https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages/pull/6
