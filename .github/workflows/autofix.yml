    # See the "advanced" section in its README for an insecure configuration that works.
    #
    # To make it secure against malicious pull requests, you cannot trust files in the PR,
    # because pull_request_target jobs have more permissions than pull_request jobs.
    # Here we place the PR's stuff to a subdirectory named "pr".
