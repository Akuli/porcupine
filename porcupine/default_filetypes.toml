# There's a friendly introduction to editing this file on Porcupine Wiki:
#
#    https://github.com/Akuli/porcupine/wiki/Getting-Porcupine-to-work-with-a-programming-language
#
# Most commonly used options (plugins may add more):
#
#    filename_patterns
#        List of strings with * used as wildcard, such as "*.py" to match files
#        named "something.py". You can also specify "foo/*.py" to only match
#        Python files inside a folder named foo, but you must use forward
#        slashes for this, even on Windows.
#
#    shebang_regex
#        Regular expression checked against the first line of a file when no
#        filename_pattern matches. See the Python documentation for supported
#        regular expression syntax:
#
#            https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax
#
#        Use single quotes to avoid having to escape backslashes.
#
#        By default, the regex may match any part of the first line. Put the
#        regex between ^ and $ to match the entire first line, e.g.
#
#            '^#!/usr/bin/python(2|3)$'
#
#        Arguments starting with '-' are ignored, so the regex '^#!/bin/foo$'
#        matches the shebang '#!/bin/foo --bar --baz'.
#
#    syntax_highlighter
#        Porcupine currently comes with two syntax highlighters that this
#        setting chooses from:
#
#            "pygments" (default)
#                This syntax highlighter supports many different languages and
#                it is easy to configure, but it is slow with large files. It
#                also has known bugs that are basically impossible to fix:
#                sometimes editing the code and reverting your edits changes how
#                the code is highlighted.
#
#                Recommended for most languages with small files.
#
#            "tree_sitter"
#                A fast highlighter that produces consistent results as the code
#                is being edited. However, this highlighter supports only a few
#                languages. Several things must be done for a language to be
#                supported, and as a user of Porcupine, you probably shouldn't
#                try to configure this highlighter yourself; just ask me to do
#                it instead by making an issue on GitHub.
#
#                Recommended for languages with large files or known bugs with
#                the "pygments" highlighter.
#
#        Regardless of this setting, the color theme is always taken from
#        Pygments, because there are many Pygments themes and it is easy to get
#        them to work with other highlighting libraries. The theme can be
#        changed in Porcupine Settings (in the Settings menu).
#
#    pygments_lexer (default: "pygments.lexers.TextLexer")
#        A class name from here:
#
#            https://pygments.org/docs/lexers/
#
#        This is used for syntax highlighting when syntax_highlighter is set to
#        "pygments". It is also used for various other things in the editor. For
#        example, when you select dpaste.com from the "Pastebin" menu at top to
#        pastebin Python code, Porcupine uses the pygments_lexer defined in the
#        [Python] section of this file to tell dpaste.com what language the code
#        is, even though the [Python] section configures Porcupine's syntax
#        highlighting to use tree_sitter instead of pygments.
#
#    tree_sitter_language_name
#        Configuration for the "tree_sitter" syntax highlighter. The following
#        file in Porcupine's source code explains this setting in more detail:
#
#            porcupine/plugins/highlight/tree-sitter-token-mappings/readme.txt
#
#    tabs2spaces (default: true)
#        If this is true, then spaces will be used for indentation.
#
#    indent_size (default: 4)
#        If tabs2spaces is false, this specifies the number of spaces
#        corresponding to one tab character. If tabs2spaces is true, then this
#        is the number of spaces used for indentation.
#
#    autoindent_regexes
#        Regexes used to determine whether the code should be indented or
#        dedented automatically when enter is pressed. Before using these
#        regexes, comments are removed and whitespace is stripped from beginning
#        and end of the line. Then the regexes are matched against the entire
#        line so that even if the regex does not use '^' or '$', it must match
#        the entire line.
#
#            indent_regex
#                A regular expression for indenting, such as '.*:' to indent
#                when a line ends with colon.
#
#            dedent_regex
#                A regular expression for dedenting.
#
#            dedent_prev_line (default: false)
#                Whether to dedent the previous line as well.
#
#        In addition to these regular expressions, (), {} and [] are supported
#        with all file types.
#
#    comment_prefix
#        If specified as one character, typing this character with many lines
#        selected will put it to the beginning of each line. For example, for
#        making comments like the comment that you are currently reading, this
#        is set to '#' in the [TOML] section. This is also used to strip
#        comments from lines of code before using autoindent_regexes.
#
#    trim_trailing_whitespace
#        Set this to false to prevent removing whitespace from ends of the lines
#        automatically when Enter is pressed. The default is true.
#
#    insert_final_newline
#        By default, Porcupine makes sure that files end with a newline when
#        saving. Set this to false to disable that.
#
#    max_line_length
#        How many characters to put before the long line marker. Set this to 0
#        or negative value to disable the long line marker.
#
#    autocomplete_chars
#        List of one-character strings. The autocompletion popup triggers
#        automatically when one of these characters is entered.
#
#    example_commands
#        List with information about a command to show in the "Run Command"
#        dialog (Shift+{F5,F6,F7,F8} by default). Each list item must have the
#        following keys:
#
#            command
#                Content of the "Run this command" text entry.
#
#            windows_command (default: same as command)
#                If this is specified and porcupine is running on Windows, it is
#                used instead of "command".
#
#            macos_command (default: same as command)
#                If this is specified and porcupine is running on MacOS, it is
#                used instead of "command".
#
#            working_directory (default: "{folder_path}")
#                Content of the "In this directory" text entry.
#
#            external_terminal (default: true)
#                Boolean: true to use a terminal or command prompt, false to run
#                within the same Porcupine window.
#
#    langserver
#        A mapping with these keys and values in it:
#
#        command
#            Command string that will be ran to start the langserver process.
#            You can use the following substitution:
#
#            {porcupine_python}
#                Path to the Python executable that Porcupine is currently
#                running with. This is not necessarily the same Python that is
#                used for running programs written by the user. For example, on
#                Windows, the Porcupine installer includes a copy of Python,
#                and {porcupine_python} points to that.
#
#            The command string is first split into parts and then substituted,
#            so you likely don't need to worry about quoting or escaping.
#
#        language_id
#            An "Identifier" from the table shown here, as a string:
#            https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#textDocumentItem
#
#        port
#            Leave this unset if you want to use stdin and stdout with the
#            langserver. If the langserver uses a TCP socket listening on
#            localhost instead, then set this to the port number that it uses.
#
#        settings
#            Configuration that will be passed to the langserver, as a nested
#            mapping. See the langserver's for what you can include here.
#
#            In strings, {python_venv} will be replaced with a path to the
#            currently selected Python virtual environment. If no venv is set,
#            the whole string will be replaced with null.
